Goals
Ensemble of trees/dnn's
Feature extraction with pca/autoencoders

- Constructed very deep feedforward neural networks using tensorflow 
  and Keras then trained them on AWS Nvidia Tesla V100 graphics cards 
- Implemented ensembles of gradient boosted decision trees with
  sklearn, catboost, xgboost, and lightgbm
- Trained models using manual and automatic hyperparameter tuning with
  skopt and Bayesian search
- Measured correlation between model predictions and built stacked 
  ensembles with least correlated estimators and mlxtend
- Completed EDA using R and ggplot2 to develop insights into material
  properties of transparent conductors
- Developed full data pipeline for automatic data transformation and
  feature engineering
